				<p>Welcome to The Republia Times. You are the new editor-in-chief.</p>
				<p>
					The war with Antegria is over and the rebellion uprising has been
					crushed. Order is slowly returning to Republia.
				</p>
				<p>The public is not loyal to the government.</p>
				<p>
					It is your job to increase their loyalty by editing The Republia Times
					carefully. Pick only stories that highlight the good things about
					Republia and its government.
				</p>
				<p>You have 3 days to raise the public's loyalty to 20.</p>
				<p>
					As a precaution against influence, we are keeping your wife and child
					in a safe location.
