[Republia Times](http://dukope.com/#trt) was created by Lucas Pope
(dukope on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dukope)
and [GitHub?](https://github.com/dukope)).
The source code for the game was released on
[Lucas Pope's website](http://dukope.com/#trt).

This is a port of the original flash game
to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,
so it can run in a web browser
without flash.

To run this code,
you'll need:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 6 or later.
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

When you have those dependencies,
clone this repository,
open a terminal or command prompt window
in the directory containing the code you just checked out, run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

If you want to contribute,
make sure you `yarn test` your changes
before submitting a pull request.

NOTE: The code is currently being updated
to use a more modern development environment
(it hasnâ€™t been touched in a while).
While this transition is in progress,
the old code can be found in the `src-old` directory.
The old code is only there for reference.
Changes should only be made to the current code.
